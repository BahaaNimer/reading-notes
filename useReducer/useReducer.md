# useReducer Hook

An alternative to `useState`. Accepts a reducer of type `(state, action) => newState`, and returns the current state paired with a `dispatch` method.

```js
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);
```

`useReducer` is usually preferable to `useState` when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. `useReducer` also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.

Example:

```js
const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

> React guarantees that `dispatch` function identity is stable and won’t change on re-renders. This is why it’s safe to omit from the `useEffect` or `useCallback` dependency list.

## Specifying the initial state

There are two different ways to initialize useReducer state.

```js
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, { count: initialCount });
```

> React doesn’t use the `state = initialState` argument convention popularized by Redux. The initial value sometimes needs to depend on props and so is specified from the Hook call instead. If you feel strongly about this, you can call `useReducer(reducer, undefined, reducer)` to emulate the Redux behavior, but it’s not encouraged.

## Lazy initialization

You can also create the initial state lazily. To do this, you can pass an `init` function as the third argument. The initial state will be set to `init(initialArg)`.

```js
function init(initialCount) {
  return { count: initialCount };
}

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    case 'reset':
      return init(action.payload);
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter({ initialCount }) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialCount, init);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button
        onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'reset', payload: initialCount })}>
        Reset
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Bailing out of a dispatch

f you return the same value from a Reducer Hook as the current state, React will bail out without rendering the children or firing effects.

> React uses the Object.is comparison algorithm.

Note that React may still need to render that specific component again before bailing out. That shouldn’t be a concern because React won’t unnecessarily go “deeper” into the tree. If you’re doing expensive calculations while rendering, you can optimize them with `useMemo`.
