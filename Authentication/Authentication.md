# Authentication

Cryptographic hash algorithms MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, SHA-3 are general purpose hash functions.

designed to calculate a digest of huge amounts of data in as short a time as possible.

Hashing is the greatest way for protecting passwords and considered to be pretty safe for ensuring the integrity of data or password.

## PROBLEMS WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH ALGORITHM

- Brute Force attack
- Hash Collision attack

## The best way

- PBKDF2
- BCrypt

> both of these algorithms use a technique called Key Stretching.

Bcrypt is an adaptive hash function based on the Blowfish symmetric block cipher cryptographic algorithm and introduces a work factor (also known as security factor), which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be.

This work factor value determines how slow the hash function will be, means different work factor will generate different hash values in different time span, which makes it extremely resistant to brute force attacks. When computers become faster next year we can increase the work factor to balance it out i.e. to make the attack slower.

## Basic access authentication

In the context of an `HTTP` transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an `HTTP user agent` (e.g. a `web browser`) to provide a `user name` and `password` when making a request. In basic `HTTP authentication`, a request contains a header field in the form of Authorization: Basic `credentials`, where credentials is the `Base64` encoding of ID and password joined by a single colon `:`.

## Features

HTTP Basic authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for enforcing `access controls` to web resources because it does not require `cookies`, `session` identifiers, or login pages; rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses standard fields in the `HTTP header`.

## Security

The BA mechanism does not provide `confidentiality` protection for the transmitted credentials.

They are merely encoded with `Base64` in transit and not `encrypted` or `hashed` in any way. Therefore, basic authentication is typically used in conjunction with `HTTPS` to provide confidentiality.

## Protocol

1. Server side

   `WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="User Visible Realm", charset="UTF-8"`

2. Client side

   `username:password or QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==`

   > Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
